# VirtualEshop-Data-Simulation
A technical demonstration of an end-to-end e-commerce data pipeline. This project includes relational schema design in Oracle SQL, a Python-based synthetic data generation engine using Faker, advanced SQL business logic, and a validated Power BI reporting layer.

Core Project Phases:

Phase 1: Database Architecture – Designing a normalized Oracle SQL schema with hierarchical category support.
Phase 2: Data Engineering – Developing a Python-based ETL engine using Faker to populate 16,000+ realistic records.
Phase 3: Analytical Logic – Create SQL queries for Market Basket Analysis.
Phase 4: Business Intelligence – Visualizing data through an interactive Power BI dashboard.





Technical Stack
Database Architecture: Oracle SQL (11g/21c) used for the relational schema foundation and constraint management.
Data Modeling: Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler for the design of both Logical and Relational entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).
Data Engineering: Python 3.x for building custom ETL pipelines and automated data ingestion scripts.
Synthetic Data Generation: Faker library used to simulate a production-scale environment with over 16,000 records across customers, products, and transactions.
Advanced Analytics: Oracle SQL Developer for developing complex business logic, including Market Basket Analysis and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) metrics.
Business Intelligence: Power BI Desktop for data transformation and the creation of an interactive reporting dashboard.
